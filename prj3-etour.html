                </p>

                <p class="quote-second">New immigrants focus on settling down in a new country as their highest priority, but emergencies can happen at any time.</p>

                <h3 class="content-title">weaknesses of the current emergency alert system</h3>
              
                <p class="real-content">
                                The government uses alerting text messages as a method to inform and alert people for emergent situations. According to the government of British Columbia, all wireless service providers are required to participate in the National Public Alerting System and use their long-term evolution networks to distribute emergency alerts since April 6, 2018. However, the emergency alerting system only notifies residents regarding an emergency that is currently happening rather than how to prepare for it. Therefore, residents need to rely on themselves to get prepared.   
                                Besides, the emergency guidance information on the government websites look overwhelmed due to poor design, lack of guidance, and redundant information. 
                                It is less common for the public to access governmental sources on a regular basis. Therefore, information around the importance of emergency preparedness should be distributed via multiple methods other than just the government’s end.                                
                         </p>
                    <h3 class="content-title">This becomes a bigger challenge for new immigrants</h3>
                  
                    <p class="real-content">
                                Canada is a large immigrant country. The majority of new immigrants focus on settling down first and lack awareness of the importance of preparing for emergencies. However, emergency preparedness should be one of the main focuses of newcomers since it can be life-threatening.   
                            </p>
                          
                            <p class="real-content">Research showed that non-English speaking immigrants find it hard to get informed in an emergencies and may easily panic since they do not understand the meaning of the messages.
                                        Different countries have different cultural differences as well, such as different beliefs, different public emergency response rules, different emergency signs with different languages, and more. 
                                        Immigrants’ behaviors and ways to perceive things are different from Canadians due to their diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences. Thus, it is important to present information about emergency preparedness more understandably and acceptably for people with all cultural backgrounds to increase awareness.  
                                        New immigrants whose English is their second language might have language barriers that may hinder their access to emergency preparedness materials that are provided in English and French. Besides, the official government website becomes more difficult for new immigrants to understand due to the current problems that already exist on the website.
                                        
                                        New immigrants' lack of awareness on emergency preparedness and the barriers they encounter regarding language, literacy, and the accessibility to the information make them vulnerable in cases of emergencies. Research showed that in British Columbia, urgent emergency-related information is only broadcasted in English. This leaves many ethnic minorities, who have difficulties with understanding English, susceptible to danger (CRTC, 2019). Besides, unfamiliarity with organizational structures and requirements in the society also hinders immigrants' accessibility to the available resources. This may lead the immigrants stranded and remain unaware of the potential emergencies.</p>

                        <p class="etour-oppurtunity-content">One insight came from the realization that new immigrants like to spend time in nearby community centers where they find people and meet friends who come from the same country. 
                                        Communities offer all kinds of information about what is happening around the neighborhoods and often host a variety of activities. We think it is a great opportunity to implement our emergency preparedness tour into community activities. 
                                        Similar to orientation events, before community centers offer their regular events/activities/courses, staff members can walk everybody through the emergency preparedness tour. This makes the tour blend in smoothly with what the community center is hosting, 
                                        and as immigrants experience the tour in person, the information presented during the tour becomes more solid in their memory.

                <h2>My Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
                <p class="content-large">During the research stage, I started with some broad research on the current weaknesses of the emergency preparedness system, which led to more deeper opportunities. We used the Synthesis Map to sort our research findings into categories and identified clusters, which helped our team feel grounded in the data that we’ve found. After narrowing down our target audience to immigrants, I started doing research related to why immigrants were not aware of emergencies. Later, we were curious about what immigrants were feeling like when they first arrived in Canada. So, I used the Empathy Map to gather some of our immigrants friends’, as long as their family members’ thoughts. Based on some stories from our interviewees, I made personas to help the team relate to our target audiences’ concerns and their goals.                                      
                </p>

                <p class="content-large">
                        During the solution phase, we all brainstormed a lot of solutions, I used the Evaluation Matrix to categorize them based on value and complexity. This method quickly helped us to land in the direction of a tour guide idea. After detailing some specifics of our solution, I used the Value Proposition Canvas again to check if our tour matches our target audiences.

                                 Listening to what people think and need always gives me valuable insights that help push my ideas forward.
