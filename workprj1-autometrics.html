              After 4 months of learning and development, the redesigned dashboard was completed and ready to be built and tested. <mark class="highlight">The whole design covers users entire experience from signing up a new project to monitoring welding parts in live and reviewing finished projects.</mark> I also created documents explaining each section and all design elements such as button style and use of colours for both future developer and designers to reference. A site map was also created to make sure that team members are familiar with how different buttons lead to different pages, and how users will be navigating through all the pages. While I cannot disclose the details of my design work, but parts of my design are public on AutoMetrics’s website.

          <p class="dark-content">
            Through this project, I learned how important it is to always<mark class="highlight white-background">first understand why we need a particular product and how its features contribute to its usefulness for users.</mark>I was tasked with working on an existing product, and 
              I learned a lot when I stepped back and gathered pain points from customers, it was the feedback that helped me understand more about the problem and set goals on how to improve the product.
              If I were to move forward with this product,  I am eager to receive feedback from both previous users of the product and first-time users, as their perspectives and interactions with the new interface will greatly inform further improvements. 
              Diversified feedback is always what makes a product evolve and empowers designers to be more confident on how to revise the product, ultimately benefiting a wider range of users over time.
