                  <mark class="highlight">The dashboard software that I mainly worked on,</mark> replaces the eyes of welders, and <mark class="highlight">is a centralized platform that helps welders better monitor and stay in control during each weld project.</mark> 
                  In brief, the dashboard monitors multiple welding jobs, provides proactive quality check, and users will get notified whenever something abnormal is being detected.

                <p class="problem-dark-content">The previous dashboard was able to measure a lot of important factors that can be crucial during the welding process, however due to the <mark class="highlight">lack of visual hirearchy, poor structure, and uneven empty space</mark> all over the interface, components and information were all crowded together. Especially when most content are supposed to update constantly during live, the dashboard <mark class="highlight">made users feel difficult to understand and rely on. 
                  Couple of the important and core features that were meant to be the selling point of the company were too vague for welders to understand thereby loose their value.</mark> Other details like naming consistency and visual elements needed to be unified and integrated. There was a lot of potential and space for improvement when the product was handed to me. 
                  We are aiming to bring users a reliable product that they can trust and monitor with during weld jobs, without physically being on site.

                    <!-- <p class="content-large-image-beside"> The challenge for me was to first understand how each section worked in the backend and what information needed to be visually represented on the dashboard front end to assist users with monitoring. On the other hand, how should I organize the dashboard, how should relatable sections be gathered together, how to make important messages stand out so that users can easily remember where to find each section, understand and keep track of variables in each section.

            While drafting out some possibilities for the dashboard, <mark class="highlight">I was in a dilemma whether to work on designing the individual components first or work on the distribution of space first.</mark> 
            The dashboard consists of individual components that have unique purposes, I started with designing the individual components first because each component had a different scenario, resulting in all kinds of layouts and formats. 
            <mark class="highlight">I wanted to explore the possibilities of different layout for each individual component and see how they mix and match together when incorporated.</mark> 
            Later I realized that <mark class="highlight">this was not a good approach</mark>, I ended up with all kinds of different design variations but when trying to fit them into one space, there were always trouble with consistency and a huge amount of changes needed to be made individually no matter how many variations I had for backup. 
            <br> <mark class="highlight">I shifted my focus to space distribution, I learned from my failure earlier that components were flexible enough to be reorganized and designed into many formats</mark>. This meant that I could plan a layout for the components according to their function and purpose, and distribute them to different areas first. 
           <mark class="highlight">Settling down on where to place all components worked well and later I still had a lot of freedom to design each component according to the amount of space they had.</mark>

                Showing the right and sufficient amount of information on the limited amount of dashboard space was a challenge. <mark class="highlight">Previously, there was redundant amount of information on the dashboard that users needed to process.
                 The important and even alarming content were easily missed</mark>, users had a hard time to understand and keep track of all the constantly updating welding information. 
                 After understanding the purpose of each component, <mark class="highlight">one challenge for me was to discuss with my project manager about what needed to be kept, how to deliver more precise messages, and reduce cognitive load.</mark> 
                 In order for <mark class="highlight">important information</mark> to stand out and easy to understand, it <mark class="highlight">needed to be amplified to catch attention with thoughtful structure and clear wordings.</mark> Even after removing a significant amount of excessive content, we realized that in order to bring users an informative yet organized interface, the remaining content still needed more than one page to fit on the dashboard. 
                 <mark class="highlight">The decisions made in this phase opened up more design opportunities like exploring ways to distribute content onto two pages.</mark> This was a big milestone that had an impact on the whole monitor experience, and users' navigation experience.

          <h2 class="glowing-title">Highlights During My Design Journey:</h2>
          <h3 class="journey-sub-first">#1 Understanding individual components</h3>
          <p class="dark-content">
            <span class="paragraph-break">In order to understand the meaning and function of each section, understand how and what sort of information needed to be delivered to welders, 
              <mark class="highlight">I listed down all the components and made a list of the purpose and function of each component to discuss with my manager, this really helped me understand how the dashboard currently operates, 
              identify questions, and come up with quick ideas on how to improve.</mark> A brief understanding process led me to more meaningful meetings with the developers, 
              and I was able to get answers, and discover underlying issues that developers had with the components.</span>
          </p>

          <h3 class="journey-sub">#2 Learning from the industry</h3>
          <p class="dark-content">
          <span class="paragraph-break">There were standard visual clues in the welding industry that welders see everyday and familiar with, for example warning signs, hazards and specific welding related signs.
             We wished to include these signs in our dashboard to easily help welders understand potential problems with signs that they are already familiar with. This really helped me consolidate my design while creating purposeful visuals that caught users attention. 
             <mark class="highlight">I did research on how other welding companies utilize signs and language in their dashboard system</mark>, and was able to learn not only design elements, but also how other companies grouped relevant information in tabs in order to utilize the limited amount of space while letting important messages stand out.
              This was a big insight for me, and later made huge impact on how I redesigned sections.</span>

          <h3 class="journey-sub">#3 Connecting with developers</h3>
          <p class="dark-content">
          <span class="paragraph-break">I gathered pain points from developers, and from my project manager while he was testing the dashboard with his clients. <mark class="highlight">Understanding the core features from developers perspectives helped me 
            understand how they imagine data getting delivered to users.</mark> This also helped me understand more about what kind of users journey users would be going through while viewing welding details on the dashboard.</span>

            <p class="dark-content">
              After 4 months of learning and development, the redesigned dashboard was completed and ready to be built and tested. <mark class="highlight">The whole design covers users entire experience from signing up a new project to monitoring welding parts in live and reviewing finished projects.</mark> I also created documents explaining each section and all design elements such as button style and use of colours for both future developer and designers to reference. A site map was also created to make sure that team members are familiar with how different buttons lead to different pages, and how users will be navigating through all the pages. While I cannot disclose the details of my design work, but parts of my design are public on AutoMetrics’s website.

            <mark class="highlight white-background">Do not get attached to any idea especially when experiments are not making much progress.</mark> I kept pushing myself to design new forms of the different components but no matter how I change the design, 
            they never fit when I try to combine them all together onto the dashboard space. Later I tried a new approach which was to distribute the amount of space for each component first, 
            Moving on to another plan not only refreshed my fogged up mindset but also fired up curiosity and the task became intriguing during the design process and opened up opportunities for problem solving. 
            As a designer I will always be  <mark class="highlight white-background">exploring new topics that I am not familiar with, finding inspiration and learning how other related companies design their products really inspired me,</mark> and kept me updated with industry standards while making my own decisions. 
            One regret is that due to my contract length, I was not able to test the dashboard with real users, and I did not get the chance to improve based on users feedback from using the new interface.
