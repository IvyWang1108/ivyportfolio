          <h2>My reflection...</h2>
          <p class="dark-content">
            <mark class="highlight white-background">Establishing a set of goals for a project is important,</mark> it helped me stick with the most important intentions and problems especially while design can go into many directions. 
            <mark class="highlight white-background">Do not get attached to any idea especially when experiments are not making much progress.</mark> I kept pushing myself to design new forms of the different components but no matter how I change the design, 
            they never fit when I try to combine them all together onto the dashboard space. Later I tried a new approach which was to distribute the amount of space for each component first, 
            Moving on to another plan not only refreshed my fogged up mindset but also fired up curiosity and the task became intriguing during the design process and opened up opportunities for problem solving. 
            As a designer I will always be  <mark class="highlight white-background">exploring new topics that I am not familiar with, finding inspiration and learning how other related companies design their products really inspired me,</mark> and kept me updated with industry standards while making my own decisions. 
            One regret is that due to my contract length, I was not able to test the dashboard with real users, and I did not get the chance to improve based on users feedback from using the new interface.
