        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>For this project, my 3 teammates and I designed a VR experience where participants mine and collect materials from e-waste while they rid an environment of toxicity, so that they can perform actions that allow them to have further environmental considerations for how they personally dispose and acquire electronics.

        <h2>The Purpose</h2>    
        <p class="content-conclusion">
                The ​improper disposal​ and ​manufacturing​ of electronics that lead to e-waste are growing contributors to carbon footprints and thus​ climate change.​ This VR experience may contribute to​ meaningful solutions (education, reuse, repair) and has the ​potential ​to ​shift perspective on relationship with technology and ​shift behavio​r on what people consider when purchasing and disposing electronics.
                The experience allows the participant to interact with and make decisions regarding objects in their environment, ​differentiating from passive VR experiences​. ​Rather than relying on guilt​ to evoke emotional response, the experience will educate by showing both positive and negative effects, and allow participants to complete a positive objective that allows for meaningful reflection post-VR.

                <p class="content-conclusion">The ​goal ​of our project is to enable participants to make informed decisions regarding the acquisition and disposal of electronics towards reducing the impact of e-waste on the environment/climate change.

                <h2 >Narrative</h2>
                <p class="content-large">The narrative is set in the near future where our team acts as a group of researchers re-visiting an old research site in a landfill area that became too dangerous due to toxicity levels. Although research utilities are stationed there, the site has not been active for a while. Luckily, the site can now be re-visited using a robot built for toxic conditions that is stationed on-site and controlled remotely. Participants act as a volunteer to operate the robot and are given a mission: to identify and mine electronic devices to reduce toxicity and collect materials for our research.</p>

                <h3 class="content-title">Premise</h3>
                <p class="real-content">participants can experience the effects e-waste has on an environment by interacting with devices that were improperly disposed of in a landfill environment. These have valuable recyclable materials and collecting them leads to change in the level of toxicity in an environment. 
                        </p>
                <h3 class="content-title">Participant's objective</h3>
                <p class="real-content">to find and mine materials from all electronic devices in the environment using their mining tool, which they are to deposit when they reach the end.​  </p>
                <h3 class="content-title">Core Interaction</h3>
                <p class="real-content">participants use a mining tool to collect materials from devices and restore it using a Tool Vendor machine by deciding to either repair or print a new one.

                    <h2>Physical Setup</h2>
                    <p class="etour-oppurtunity-content">Due to Covid-19, we did not showcase our project as planned. Instead, I made a mockup of how the physical setup would look like. Participants walk into a tent that acts as a remote research station and are greeted by our team dressed as researchers.
                            Monitors are set up on the table to the left of the space. An adjacent table showcases a selection of electronic parts and commonly found older devices. This is to emphasize that the research station is studying the effect of e-waste and let participants see examples of familiar devices that can still be recycled. The organization of the tables and seating area is intended to allow for some privacy. On the physical grid stand, we also present images of what the research site used to look like and what it has become along with our research group logo correspodning to what participants see in the virtual environment.

                <h2>My Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
                <p class="content-conclusion"> 
                    My role was to collect assets that can be placed in the environment of our project. The direction of my part was to find assets that could match the tone and objective of this experience. Considering the style of assets and feeling of harmony, I tried to mix and match a variety of assets and assemble them into one environment. Placing assets together in different forms felt like creating stories and giving objects different characteristics. I created a few options for what the environment could look like for the team and considered some aspects of level design as well.       
                     </p>
                <p class="content-conclusion">
                    During the second half of this project, I mianly worked on sound design. We wanted this VR experience to be realistic letting participants feel like they are in a near future, so my challenge was to search for elements of sound that were realistic like everyday life for players to persistently stay immersed but to also match with some of the futuristic and robotic elements within the environment. I ended up mixing soundtracks to get the desired sound effect, which was fun and I really enjoyed the process.

                <h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
                <p class="content-conclusion"> 
                    This VR project also required a lot of thinking towards user experience. I learned a lot about level design and how to navigate players within an open environment. It was challenging but fun to search for all kinds of assets that could help me build up a story for the environment and to create an atmosphere that would attract players during the whole experience. Overall, after this project, I gained experience in ways to place elements strategically that can subtly lead players through a pathway. More importantly, I had the chance to develop my thinking skills towards creating a solution for a current global challenge that needs to directly point out the problem; shift players' perspective, and let players understand how to help ease the problem.
